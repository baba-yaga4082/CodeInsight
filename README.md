🧠 CodeInsight
CodeInsight is an interactive algorithm visualization and code execution platform built with React and TypeScript. It allows students and developers to understand how algorithms work in real time through visualizations, live code execution via the Judge0 API, and complexity analysis — all in one seamless interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React + TypeScript: For building scalable, type-safe frontends.
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui: For modern, responsive UI components.
Judge0 API: Executes code and captures outputs in real time.
D3.js / react-force-graph: For dynamic graph-based visualizations.
Vite: For lightning-fast development build tooling.
✨ Features
📊 Algorithm Visualizations
Graph-based rendering for algorithms like Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Dijkstra’s, BFS, and DFS.

💻 Code Execution
Run code instantly using Judge0 with syntax validation and live output.

🧮 Complexity Analysis
View time and space complexity for supported algorithms.

⚡ Live Feedback
Real-time editor updates with instant visualization refresh.

🧩 Extensible Design
Easily add new algorithms via plug-and-play architecture.
